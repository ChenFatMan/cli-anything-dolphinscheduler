"""End-to-end tests against a real DolphinScheduler server.

These tests require:
1. A running DolphinScheduler instance (Docker Compose / standalone)
2. Admin credentials (default: admin / dolphinscheduler123)
3. Network access to the API server

Run with:
    pytest -v tests/test_full_e2e.py

Skip if server unavailable:
    pytest -v tests/test_full_e2e.py -m "not e2e"
