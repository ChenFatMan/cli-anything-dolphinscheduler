"""Project operations for DolphinScheduler.

A *project* is the top-level container in DolphinScheduler; workflows, schedules,
and instances all live under a project identified by its numeric ``code`` (a
snowflake long). These helpers wrap the ``projects`` controller and add the
name-to-code lookup that agents need, since most day-to-day references are by
human-readable name rather than code.
